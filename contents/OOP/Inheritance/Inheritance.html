			<p>sometimes you want one class of objects to have the powers an abilities (that is, attributes and methods) of another class. Instead of starting from scratch, you can create a class by deriving it from a preexisting class by listing the parent class in parentheses after the new class name.</p>
			<p>The <em>child</em> class <em>inherits</em> the <em>attributes and methods</em> of its parent class, and <em>you can use those attributes and methods as if they were defined in the child class</em>. A child class can also override data members and methods from the parent.</p>
			<p>Derived classes are declared much like their parent class; however, a list of base classes to inherit from are given after the class name:</p>
			<pre><code>class SubClassName (ParentClass1&lt;, ParentClass2, ...&gt;):
	'Optional class documentation string'
	class_suite</pre></code>
			
			<p>You can use <em>issubclass()</em> or <em>isinstance()</em> functions to <em>check a relationships of two classes</em> and instances:</p>

    	<dl>
    		<dt>issubclass(sub, sup)</dt>
    			<dd><p>returns true if the given subclass <em>sub</em> is indeed a subclass of the superclass <em>sup</em>.</p></dd>
    		<dt>isinstance(obj, Class)</dt>
    			<dd>returns true if <em>obj</em> is an instance of class <em>Class</em> or is an instance of a subclass of Class</dd>
    	</dl>

			<h2 id="">Overriding methods</h2>
			<p>Sometimes you'll want one class that inherits from another to not only take on the methods and attributes of its parent, but to override one or more of them.</p>
			<p>You can always override your parent class methods. One reason for overriding parent's methods is because you may want special or different functionality of the same method in your subclass.</p>
			<p>To overwrite a method only rewrite the method in the subclass, and python will take the last generation definition to run the method when it's called from a subclass instanced object</p>
			
			<h2 id="">Using original overriding methods</h2>
			<p>Sometimes you'll be working with a derived class (or <em>subclass</em>) and realize that you've overwritten a method or attribute defined in that base class (also called a <em>parent</em> or <em>superclass</em>) that you actually need. When this happens, you can directly <em>access the attributes or methods of a superclass</em> with Python's<em> built-in super call</em>.</p>

			<p>The syntax looks like this:</p>
			
			<pre><code>class DerivedClass(Base):
	def some_method(self):
		super(DerivedClass, self).meth()
			</pre></code>
			
			<p>Where meth() is a method from the base class.</p>
